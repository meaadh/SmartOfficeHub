Answer: Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It takes each element and inserts it into its correct position in the already sorted part of the array, moving forward until no unsorted elements remain.

Question ID: Q1007
Question: What is the key idea behind Quick Sort?
Answer: The key idea behind Quick Sort is to select a 'pivot' element and partition the array around the pivot, ensuring that elements less than the pivot are on one side and greater on the other. This process is then recursively applied to the sub-arrays.

Question ID: Q1008
Question: How does Merge Sort achieve sorting?
Answer: Merge Sort works by dividing the array into halves, sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves back together. This divide-and-conquer approach is efficient and results in 
O(nlogn) time complexity.

Answer: Heap Sort is considered efficient due to its O(nlogn) time complexity for both the worst and average cases. It sorts an array by building a heap data structure from the unsorted elements and then repeatedly extracting the maximum element from the heap.

Question ID: Q1011
Question: What is the basic mechanism of the Bubble Sort algorithm?
Answer: The basic mechanism of Bubble Sort involves repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.

Question ID: Q1012
Question: How does Insertion Sort differ from Selection Sort?
Answer: Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly taking the next unsorted item and inserting it into its correct position. Selection Sort, on the other hand, selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and moves it to the end of the sorted portion.

Question ID: Q1013

Question ID: Q1047
Question: How does Heap Sort ensure the largest element is placed at the end of the list?
Answer: Heap Sort first arranges the list into a max heap, where the largest element is at the root of the heap. It then swaps the root with the last item of the list and reduces the heap size. This process is repeated to place the largest elements at the end of the list.

Question ID: Q1048
Question: What kind of sorting is Selection Sort, and what does it do each iteration?
Answer: Selection Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. Each iteration, it selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first unsorted element, progressively moving the boundary of the sorted portion.

Question ID: Q1049
Question: How does the efficiency of Radix Sort compare with comparison-based sorting algorithms?
