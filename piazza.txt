Yes you can do quicksort on a singly linked list, a vector and a doubly linked list. 

Time complexities: 
singly linked: O(n^2) worst case O(nlogn) average case. Here is an implementation. 

doubly linked: O(n^2) worst case, O(nlogn) average case (follows from the singly linked list case) 

vector: O(n^2) worst case, O(nlogn) average case (as discussed in lecture).
