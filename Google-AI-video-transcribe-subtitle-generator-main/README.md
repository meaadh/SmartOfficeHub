## Explanation of functions

`upload_blob()` - Uploads the media file to the Google Storaege bucket.

`video_info()` - Returns number of channels, bit rate, and sample rate of the video, extracted by running `ffmpeg`. These parameters are required by Google's API.

`video_to_audio()` - Converts video into audio, and upload the audio to the Google Storaege bucket.

`long_running_recognize()` - Transcribes the audio by calling Google Cloud API.

`break_sentences()` - Breaks sentences by punctuations and maximum sentence length. This ensures that in the video subtitle, the sentence won't be too long.
