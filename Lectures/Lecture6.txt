Transcript: Today we're going to learn Bubble Sort.

ID: L62
Time: 3.00
Transcript: Here's what we'll do.

ID: L63
Time: 5.00
Transcript: We're going to compare consecutive items.

ID: L64
Time: 8.00
Transcript: If they're out of place, we'll swap them.

ID: L65
Time: 12.00
Transcript: The highest number will bubble its way to the right with each iteration.

ID: L66
Time: 18.00
Transcript: A sorted partition will form at the end of the array.

ID: L67
Time: 22.00
Transcript: It's pretty simple, so I'll be quiet and let you watch.

ID: L68
Time: 30.00
Transcript: Let's see how it works.

ID: L69
Time: 48.00
Transcript: Done with the first iteration.

ID: L610
Time: 50.00
Transcript: 9 is now in the correct spot. Let's continue.

ID: L611
Time: 60.00
Transcript: You get the picture. I'll see you at the end of the algorithm.

ID: L612
Time: 90.00
Transcript: We're done. Our array is sorted.

ID: L613
Time: 112.00
Transcript: Here's the pseudocode for Bubble Sort.

ID: L614
Time: 116.00
Transcript: As you can guess from the nested for loop, the worst case time complexity is O of n squared, where n is the size of the array.
