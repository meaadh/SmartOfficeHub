00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Today we're going to learn Bubble Sort.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here's what we'll do.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We're going to compare consecutive items.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
If they're out of place, we'll swap them.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The highest number will bubble its way to the right with each iteration.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A sorted partition will form at the end of the array.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's pretty simple, so I'll be quiet and let you watch.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's see how it works.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Done with the first iteration.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
9 is now in the correct spot. Let's continue.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You get the picture. I'll see you at the end of the algorithm.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We're done. Our array is sorted.

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Here's the pseudocode for Bubble Sort.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,000
As you can guess from the nested for loop, the worst case time complexity is O of n squared, where n is the size of the array.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
