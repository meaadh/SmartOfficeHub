Transcript: Today, we're going to learn quicksort.

ID: L22
Time: 3.54
Transcript: Like merge sort, quicksort is a recursive algorithm.

ID: L23
Time: 6.72
Transcript: However, when you think of quicksort, I want you to think of the word pivot.

ID: L24
Time: 11.88
Transcript: A pivot is simply one of the items in the array that meets the following three conditions.

ID: L25
Time: 16.60
Transcript: after we sorted it.

ID: L26
Time: 18.60
Transcript: First, the pivot is in its correct position in the final sorted array.

ID: L27
Time: 23.72
Transcript: This means that all items to the left are smaller, and all items to the right are larger.

ID: L28
Time: 29.64
Transcript: Let's look at an example.

ID: L29
Time: 32.64
Transcript: We're asked to sort the following array.

ID: L210
Time: 35.68
Transcript: Let's choose a pivot.

ID: L211
Time: 37.50
Transcript: I'll explain the best way to do this later, but for now, let's just choose three.

ID: L212
Time: 42.72
Transcript: First, we move the pivot to the end of the array to get it out of our way.

ID: L213
Time: 48.72
Transcript: Next, we're going to look for two items.

ID: L214
Time: 53.54
Transcript: Item from left, which is the first item, starting from the left, that is larger than our pivot.

ID: L215
Time: 59.52
Transcript: Second, item from right, which is the first item, starting from the right, that is smaller.

ID: L216
Time: 64.80
Transcript: than our pivot.

ID: L217
Time: 69.30
Transcript: Starting at two, we can see that six is item from left.

ID: L218
Time: 75.44
Transcript: Now starting at the right, we see that one is item from right.

ID: L219
Time: 81.92
Transcript: Let's swap item from left with item from right.

ID: L220
Time: 88.16
Transcript: We repeat the process.

ID: L221
Time: 90.10
Transcript: This time, five is item from left, and zero is item from right.

ID: L222
Time: 96.72
Transcript: Again, we swap the two.

ID: L223
Time: 105.96
Transcript: One more time. This time, we see that item from left has a greater index than item from right, so we.

ID: L224
Time: 112.24
Transcript: know we're done.

ID: L225
Time: 118.08
Transcript: We swap item from left with our pivot.

ID: L226
Time: 123.64
Transcript: Three, our pivot is now in its correct spot.

ID: L227
Time: 131.00
Transcript: To prove it, let's review our three conditions.

ID: L228
Time: 134.40
Transcript: As you can see, all items to the left are smaller, and all items to the right are larger.

ID: L229
Time: 141.60
Transcript: We said quicksort is recursive.

ID: L230
Time: 143.84
Transcript: Let's go through the process one more time with the larger partition we just made.

ID: L231
Time: 149.20
Transcript: We'll choose seven as our pivot and move it to the end.

ID: L232
Time: 159.48
Transcript: I'll let you watch without voiceover.

ID: L233
Time: 189.48
Transcript: Now, we have three and seven in their correct positions.

ID: L234
Time: 196.04
Transcript: I think you understand the concept, so we'll let recursion handle the rest. One important question is how do we choose the pivot?.

ID: L235
Time: 207.40
Transcript: This makes a large difference in the performance of the algorithm, as we want to choose a pivot.

ID: L236
Time: 212.20
Transcript: that divides the array in half or as close as possible to even out the work.

ID: L237
Time: 218.48
Transcript: One popular method is called median of three.

ID: L238
Time: 221.16
Transcript: In this method, we look at the first, middle, and last elements of the array.

ID: L239
Time: 228.20
Transcript: We sort them properly and choose the middle item as our pivot. We're making the guess that the middle of these three items could be close to the median.

ID: L240
Time: 236.64
Transcript: of the entire array, and as you can see, it's not too far off.

ID: L241
Time: 242.20
Transcript: Here's the pseudocode for quicksort. Quicksort has the worst case time complexity of big O of n squared, but if a pivot is chosen.

ID: L242
Time: 253.08
Transcript: properly, it can be shown to have an average case of big O of n log n.
